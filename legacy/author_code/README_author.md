# Activation-Steered Compression (ASC)

**Activation-Steered Compression (ASC)** is a training-free method that compresses verbose reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference time by manipulating internal activations. It achieves substantial reductions in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length while preserving, or even improving, answer accuracy — enabling faster, more efficient, and cost-effective deployment of reasoning models.

> **Activation Steering for Chain-of-Thought Compression**

## 🚀 Overview

Chain-of-Thought prompting improves reasoning but often leads to:
- Verbose explanations
- Redundant reasoning steps
- Increased token usage and latency

ASC addresses this inefficiency by:
- Extracting a **steering vector** from paired verbose vs. concise rationales
- Injecting it into the model’s residual stream at inference time
- Compressing CoTs without retraining or fine-tuning

## 🧠 Key Features

- ⚙️ **Training-free**: Works on any model without parameter updates
- 💡 **Concise reasoning**: Reduces CoT length by up to 67%
- ⚡ **Efficient inference**: Up to 2.73× speedup in wall-clock time
- 🧪 **Model-agnostic**: Works across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models
- 📐 **Theoretical guarantees**: KL-bounded scaling ensures safe intervention

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArminAzizi98/ASC.git
cd ASC
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Inference Example

The easiest way to use ASC during inference is with the `--steering` flag:

```bash
python -u generate.py \
  --model_name "Qwen/QwQ-32B" \
  --problem '''Define
\[p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} \quad \text{and} \quad q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}.\]
Find a way to write
\[\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\]
in terms of $p$ and $q.$''' \
  --steering
```
You may provide any math problem as the `--problem` argument. 



## 🧭 Creating Steering Vectors

To generate a steering vector for a new model or domain, follow these steps:

1. **Generate Concise CoTs using GPT-4o**  
   Requires access to the OpenAI ChatGPT API. This script prompts GPT-4o to produce math-centric, minimal-English rationales.
   ```bash
   python generate_short_cots.py

2. **Generate Verbose CoTs using the Target Model**
   The following script generates standard chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs from your chosen reasoning model.
   ```bash
   python generate_long_cots.py

3. **Extract the Steering Vector**
   Use this script to compute the activation-space vector that maps verbose to concise reasoning, based on the CoT pairs.
   ```bash
   python extract_steering_vector.py
